# Web Scraping and Data Analysis Project Summary
- This project focuses on enhancing web scraping and data analysis skills. It leverages techniques learned to identify HTML elements, extract information from web pages, and analyze structured data. The core objectives include scraping titles and preview text from Mars news articles and analyzing Mars weather data available in tabular format.

## Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
  - Utilize automated browsing and Beautiful Soup to extract information from the Mars News website.
  - Extract titles and preview text of news articles.
  - Store the data in Python dictionaries and a list.

## Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
  - Use automated browsing and Beautiful Soup to scrape Mars weather data from a specified website.
  - Assemble the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame.
  - Analyze the dataset to answer specific questions using Pandas functions:
  - Determine the number of months on Mars.
  - Calculate the Martian days (sols) worth of data in the dataset.
  - Identify the coldest and warmest months on Mars.
  - Determine the months with the lowest and highest atmospheric pressure on Mars.
  - Estimate the number of terrestrial (Earth) days in a Martian year visually.
  - Export the DataFrame to a CSV file.
